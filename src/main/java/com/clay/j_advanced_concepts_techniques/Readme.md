## Thread Starvation:

Thread starvation occurs when a thread is unable to make progress or complete its task due to a lack of available resources or scheduling issues. 
It can lead to performance degradation and the overall responsiveness of an application. 

### Here are some common scenarios that can cause thread starvation:

1. #### Resource Starvation: 
If a thread requires exclusive access to a shared resource, but other threads are holding the resource for extended periods, the waiting thread may starve. For example, if multiple threads are competing for a lock, and one thread continuously acquires and holds the lock for a long time, other threads waiting for the lock may starve.

2. #### Priority Inversion: 
In a scenario where multiple threads with different priorities are contending for resources, priority inversion can occur. Priority inversion happens when a lower-priority thread holds a resource needed by a higher-priority thread. This can cause the higher-priority thread to wait indefinitely, leading to thread starvation.

3. #### Scheduling Issues: 
In some cases, the thread scheduler may not allocate sufficient CPU time to a particular thread due to scheduling algorithms or system load. This can cause the thread to make slow progress or appear starved.

### To mitigate thread starvation, consider the following approaches:

1. #### Ensure fair resource allocation: 
Use fair locking mechanisms that ensure threads waiting for a resource are given an opportunity to acquire it, preventing indefinite starvation.

2. #### Use thread pooling: 
Employ thread pools and appropriate thread pool configurations to limit the number of concurrent threads and manage resource consumption effectively.

3. #### Optimize resource usage: 
Identify and optimize resource-intensive operations to minimize the time threads spend waiting for resources.

4. #### Review scheduling policies: 
Understand the thread scheduling policies of the underlying platform and consider adjusting thread priorities or scheduling parameters if necessary.

## Deadlock:
Deadlock is a situation in which two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release resources that they hold. 

### It occurs when the following four conditions are met:

1. #### Mutual Exclusion: 
This condition states that at least one resource must be held in a non-sharable mode, meaning only one process can use it at a time. If a resource is already allocated to one process, it cannot be simultaneously used by another process.

#### Example: 
Consider a printer that can only be used by one process at a time. If Process A has acquired the printer, Process B must wait until it is released before it can use it. This mutual exclusion creates a potential for deadlock if multiple processes are competing for the same printer resource.

2. #### Hold and Wait: 
This condition states that a process must be holding at least one resource while waiting to acquire additional resources. In other words, a process that has already acquired some resources can request additional resources without releasing its current holdings.

#### Example: 
Imagine two processes, Process A and Process B, where Process A has acquired Resource X and is waiting to acquire Resource Y, while Process B has acquired Resource Y and is waiting for Resource X. Both processes are holding one resource and waiting for the other, leading to a potential deadlock situation.

3. #### No Preemption: 
This condition states that resources cannot be forcibly taken away from a process. Only the process itself can release the resources it holds voluntarily.

#### Example: 
Suppose Process A has acquired Resource X and Process B has acquired Resource Y. If Process B needs Resource X to proceed, it cannot forcefully take Resource X from Process A. Instead, it must wait for Process A to release Resource X. This lack of preemption can lead to deadlock if the necessary resources are not released in a timely manner.

4. #### Circular Wait: 
This condition states that a circular chain of two or more processes exists, where each process is waiting for a resource held by the next process in the chain.

#### Example: 
Consider three processes, Process A, Process B, and Process C. Process A is waiting for a resource held by Process B, Process B is waiting for a resource held by Process C, and Process C is waiting for a resource held by Process A. This circular dependency creates a deadlock situation as none of the processes can proceed without releasing the resources they hold, which they cannot do due to the circular wait.

#### Deadlock Example
```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class DeadlockExample {
    private static Lock lock1 = new ReentrantLock();
    private static Lock lock2 = new ReentrantLock();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            // Condition 1: Mutual Exclusion
            lock1.lock();
            System.out.println("Thread 1: Acquired lock1");
            
            // Condition 2: Hold and Wait
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulating some work
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            lock2.lock();
            System.out.println("Thread 1: Acquired lock2");
            
            // Perform some actions
            
            lock1.unlock();
            lock2.unlock();
        });

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            // Condition 1: Mutual Exclusion
            lock2.lock();
            System.out.println("Thread 2: Acquired lock2");
            
            // Condition 2: Hold and Wait
            lock1.lock();
            System.out.println("Thread 2: Acquired lock1");
            
            // Perform some actions
            
            lock2.unlock();
            lock1.unlock();
        });

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:

1. Mutual Exclusion: The code uses two locks, lock1 and lock2. Each thread tries to acquire the locks in a different order. If both threads acquire one lock and then attempt to acquire the other lock, a deadlock can occur.

2. Hold and Wait: Each thread holds one lock ('lock1' or 'lock2') and waits to acquire the other lock. This demonstrates the hold and wait condition, as the threads hold their acquired lock while waiting for the other lock.

3. No Preemption: The code does not include any mechanism to preemptively release locks. The threads cannot forcibly take the lock from each other, and they must wait until the other thread releases the lock it holds.

4. Circular Wait: Both threads try to acquire locks in a circular manner. Thread 1 acquires 'lock1' and waits for 'lock2', while Thread 2 acquires 'lock2' and waits for 'lock1'. This circular dependency creates the potential for a deadlock.


### To prevent and resolve deadlocks, consider the following strategies:

1. #### Resource Ordering: 
Establish a consistent order in which resources are acquired to prevent circular wait conditions. Threads should always request resources in the same order to avoid deadlock.

2. #### Resource Allocation Strategies: 
Utilize techniques such as resource allocation graphs, bankers' algorithm, or deadlock detection algorithms to manage resource allocation and avoid potential deadlocks.

3. #### Avoid Hold and Wait: 
Implement strategies to ensure that a thread requests all the required resources upfront before execution, rather than holding some resources and then waiting for others.

4. #### Timeouts and Deadlock Detection: 
Set timeouts for resource acquisition, so if a thread is unable to acquire a resource within a specified time, it can release its held resources and retry or take alternative actions. Deadlock detection algorithms can also periodically check for deadlock conditions and take appropriate actions.

5. #### Thread Interruption: 
Use thread interruption mechanisms to break out of potential deadlock situations and handle them gracefully.

6. #### Design Considerations: 
Review and analyze the system design to identify potential deadlock-prone scenarios. Ensure that proper synchronization techniques and resource management practices are followed.
