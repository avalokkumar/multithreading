Synchronization and coordination between threads are essential concepts in multithreaded programming to ensure proper execution order, consistency, and prevent race conditions. These mechanisms enable threads to work together, share resources, and exchange information in a controlled and synchronized manner. Let's explore synchronization and coordination in detail:

## Synchronization:

### Mutual Exclusion: 
Synchronization provides mutual exclusion, ensuring that only one thread can access a critical section of code or a shared resource at a time. This prevents race conditions and maintains data integrity.
Locking Mechanisms: Locks, such as mutexes (mutual exclusion), semaphores, and monitors, are used to control access to shared resources. A thread acquires the lock before entering a critical section and releases it afterward, allowing other threads to proceed.
Atomic Operations: Atomic operations are indivisible and thread-safe operations, ensuring that they are executed as a single, uninterruptible unit. They can be used to perform concurrent operations without the need for explicit locking.
Coordination:

### Signaling Mechanisms: 
Signaling allows threads to communicate and coordinate their activities. Common signaling mechanisms include condition variables, event objects, and semaphores. Threads can wait for a specific condition to be met or signal other threads to proceed.
Wait and Notify: Threads can wait for a condition to become true using the wait() method, suspending their execution until another thread notifies them using the notify() or notifyAll() methods. This allows threads to synchronize their actions based on specific conditions.
Thread Joining: Thread joining allows one thread to wait for the completion of another thread. By calling the join() method on a thread, the calling thread waits until the joined thread finishes its execution.
Benefits of Synchronization and Coordination:

### Thread Safety: 
Synchronization ensures thread safety by preventing data races and maintaining consistency when multiple threads access shared resources.
Resource Sharing: Synchronization and coordination mechanisms enable threads to safely share resources, such as data structures, files, or network connections.
Orderly Execution: Synchronization allows threads to execute in a specified order, ensuring dependencies and sequence requirements are met.
Deadlock Prevention: Coordinating threads helps prevent deadlocks, where threads are indefinitely blocked waiting for each other to release resources.
Parallelism and Concurrency: By synchronizing and coordinating threads, parallelism (simultaneous execution on multiple processors) and concurrency (overlapping execution) can be achieved, leading to improved performance and responsiveness.

## Coordination:

### Signaling Mechanisms: 
Signaling allows threads to communicate and coordinate their activities. Common signaling mechanisms include condition variables, event objects, and semaphores. Threads can wait for a specific condition to be met or signal other threads to proceed.

### Wait and Notify: 
Threads can wait for a condition to become true using the `wait()` method, suspending their execution until another thread notifies them using the `notify()` or `notifyAll()` methods. This allows threads to synchronize their actions based on specific conditions.

### Thread Joining: 
Thread joining allows one thread to wait for the completion of another thread. By calling the `join()` method on a thread, the calling thread waits until the joined thread finishes its execution.

## Thread States

### New:

The new state represents a thread that has been created but has not yet started its execution.
In this state, the thread's resources, such as memory and program counter, have been allocated but its code has not yet begun execution.

* The "new" state represents a thread that has been created but has not yet started its execution.
* At this stage, the thread object has been instantiated, but the underlying thread of execution has not begun.
* Initialization tasks and resource allocation specific to the thread can be performed in this state.
```java
Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
    // Thread's task or code to be executed
    System.out.println("Thread execution started");
});

// The thread is now in the "new" state

// Start the thread execution
thread.start();
```

In above example, a new thread is created using the Thread class constructor, and a task is defined using a lambda 
expression. The thread is then started using the start() method, transitioning it from the "new" state to the "runnable" state.

#### Advanced Concepts:

* Advanced techniques and tools are available to manage and manipulate threads in the "new" state.
* Thread factories and thread pools offer more control and flexibility in creating and managing threads.
* Frameworks and libraries, such as Java's Executor framework or Java Concurrency API, provide higher-level abstractions for creating and executing tasks on new threads.

#### Example using Executor Framework:

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);

Runnable task = () -> {
    // Thread's task or code to be executed
    System.out.println("Thread execution started");
};

// Submit the task for execution
Future<?> future = executor.submit(task);

// The thread is now in the "new" state, waiting to be scheduled by the executor

// Shutdown the executor after all tasks have completed
executor.shutdown();
```

> In the above example, an ExecutorService is used to manage a pool of threads. The submit() method is used to submit a task (implemented as a Runnable) for execution. The executor takes care of creating and managing threads, transitioning them from the "new" state to the "runnable" state.


### Runnable:

Threads in the runnable state are eligible for execution by the CPU.
The thread scheduler determines when to execute them, and they can be executing, waiting for their turn, or waiting for system resources.
Threads in this state are contending for CPU time and can transition to the running state when the scheduler assigns processing time to them.

* The "runnable" state represents a thread that is eligible to run but may or may not be currently executing.
* In this state, the thread has been started and is ready to be scheduled for execution by the underlying thread scheduler.
* The thread may be executing its code or waiting for its turn to execute on the CPU.

#### Example:
```java
Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
    // Thread's task or code to be executed
    System.out.println("Thread execution started");
});

// Start the thread execution
thread.start();

// The thread is now in the "runnable" state, waiting for its turn to be scheduled and executed
```
> In the above example, a new thread is created using the Thread class constructor, and a task is defined using a lambda expression. The thread is then started using the start() method, transitioning it from the "new" state to the "runnable" state.

#### Advanced Concepts:

* Advanced techniques and tools are available to manage and optimize threads in the "runnable" state.
* Thread priorities can be set to influence the order in which threads are scheduled for execution.
* Synchronization mechanisms like locks, semaphores, and barriers can be used to coordinate the execution of multiple threads.
* Thread pooling and task scheduling frameworks provide efficient ways to manage runnable threads and improve performance.

#### Example using Executor Framework:
```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);

Runnable task = () -> {
    // Thread's task or code to be executed
    System.out.println("Thread execution started");
};

// Submit the task for execution
Future<?> future = executor.submit(task);

// The thread is now in the "runnable" state, waiting to be scheduled by the executor

// Shutdown the executor after all tasks have completed
executor.shutdown();
```

> In the above given example, an ExecutorService is used to manage a pool of threads. The submit() method is used to submit a task (implemented as a Runnable) for execution. The executor takes care of creating and managing threads, transitioning them from the "new" state to the "runnable" state.


### Blocked:

Threads enter the blocked state when they are waiting for a specific condition to be satisfied or a certain resource to become available.
Common scenarios for threads to be blocked include waiting for I/O operations to complete, acquiring locks, or waiting for another thread to release a resource.
While in the blocked state, the thread temporarily gives up its execution and doesn't consume CPU resources.


* The "blocked" state represents a thread that is temporarily unable to run because it is waiting for a certain 
condition or resource.
* Threads can enter the blocked state due to synchronization issues or resource contention, where they need access to a lock held by another thread.
* Once the blocking condition is resolved, the thread transitions back to the "runnable" state and competes for CPU execution time.

```java
class SharedResource {
    public synchronized void performOperation() {
        // Thread-safe operation that requires exclusive access
        // Other threads will be blocked until this operation completes
    }
}

class MyThread extends Thread {
    private SharedResource resource;

    public MyThread(SharedResource resource) {
        this.resource = resource;
    }

    public void run() {
        // Perform some work

        // Acquire the lock on the shared resource
        synchronized (resource) {
            // Execute a synchronized block, which may take some time
            resource.performOperation();
        }

        // Continue with other work
    }
}

// Create a shared resource instance
SharedResource resource = new SharedResource();

// Create multiple threads that need access to the shared resource
Thread thread1 = new MyThread(resource);
Thread thread2 = new MyThread(resource);

// Start the threads
thread1.start();
thread2.start();
```

> In the above example, multiple threads (thread1 and thread2) are created to perform some work. Both threads require access to a shared resource represented by the SharedResource class. The performOperation() method of the shared resource is synchronized, allowing only one thread to execute it at a time. When a thread enters the synchronized block, other threads attempting to enter the same block will be blocked until the executing thread releases the lock.

#### Advanced Concepts:

* Advanced techniques and tools can be used to handle the "blocked" state more effectively.
* Concurrent data structures, such as concurrent queues or locks with fairness policies, can help manage resource contention and reduce blocking.
* Thread profiling and monitoring tools can provide insights into blocking scenarios, identifying potential bottlenecks and areas for optimization.
* Asynchronous programming models and non-blocking algorithms can be employed to minimize thread blocking and improve overall system performance.

#### Example using Lock and Condition:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

class SharedResource {
    private Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private Condition condition = lock.newCondition();
    private boolean conditionMet = false;

    public void performOperation() {
        // Acquire the lock
        lock.lock();
        try {
            // Perform the operation

            // Wait until a certain condition is met
            while (!conditionMet) {
                condition.await();
            }

            // Continue with the operation
            System.out.println("Performing operation on the shared resource");
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        } finally {
            // Release the lock
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public void signalCondition() {
        // Acquire the lock
        lock.lock();
        try {
            // Modify the condition
            conditionMet = true;

            // Signal waiting threads that the condition has changed
            condition.signalAll();
        } finally {
            // Release the lock
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}

class MyThread extends Thread {
    private SharedResource resource;

    public MyThread(SharedResource resource) {
        this.resource = resource;
    }

    public void run() {
        // Perform some work
        System.out.println("Thread started");

        // Execute the operation on the shared resource
        resource.performOperation();

        // Continue with other work
        System.out.println("Thread ended");
    }
}

    // Create a shared resource instance
    SharedResource resource = new SharedResource();

    // Create multiple threads that need access to the shared resource
    Thread thread1 = new MyThread(resource);
    Thread thread2 = new MyThread(resource);
    Thread thread3 = new MyThread(resource);

// Start the threads
thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
        thread3.start();

// Wait for the threads to finish
        thread1.join();
        thread2.join();
        thread3.join();

// Signal the condition
        resource.signalCondition();
```

> In above example, SharedResource is a class that represents a shared resource that multiple threads need access to. The `performOperation()` method of this class acquires a lock, performs some operation on the shared resource, and then waits until a certain condition is met. The `signalCondition()` method of this class modifies the condition and signals waiting threads that the condition has changed.

> The MyThread class extends the Thread class and represents a thread that needs access to the shared resource. In its `run()` method, it performs some work, executes the `performOperation()` method on the shared resource, and then continues with other work.

> At the end of the code, we create multiple threads that need access to the shared resource, start them, and then wait for them to finish using `join()`. Finally, we signal the condition by calling `signalCondition()` on the shared resource object. This wakes up all waiting threads, which can then continue with their operations.


### Terminated:
The "Terminated" thread state represents the final state of a thread when it has completed its execution or has been terminated abruptly. In this state, the thread has finished executing its tasks and is no longer active. Once a thread enters the "Terminated" state, it cannot transition to any other state.

When a thread is terminated, its resources are released, including its stack space and any locks it holds. The termination can occur naturally when the thread completes its execution, or it can be forced by calling the interrupt() method on the thread object.

#### Example
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        try {
            // Perform some work or computations
            System.out.println("Thread is executing...");

            // Simulate some processing time
            Thread.sleep(2000);

            // After completing the work, the thread terminates
            System.out.println("Thread has finished executing.");
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}

public class ThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a thread object
        Thread thread = new MyThread();

        // Start the thread
        thread.start();

        try {
            // Wait for the thread to finish
            thread.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // After the thread has terminated, it is in the "Terminated" state
        System.out.println("Thread state: " + thread.getState());
    }
}
```

> In above example, we create a custom thread class MyThread that extends the Thread class. In its run() method, the thread performs some work or computations and then terminates naturally by reaching the end of the method. Inside the main() method, we create an instance of MyThread, start it, and wait for it to finish using the join() method. After the thread has terminated, we print its state, which will be "Terminated".

## Thread Priorities and Scheduling:

Thread priorities and scheduling play a crucial role in determining the order and allocation of CPU time to threads in a multithreaded application. Thread priorities define the relative importance or urgency of a thread's execution compared to other threads. The thread scheduler uses these priorities to make scheduling decisions, determining which thread should be executed next.

### Thread Priorities:
Thread priorities are represented by integers and typically range from 1 (lowest priority) to 10 (highest priority). However, the exact range of priorities and their mapping to actual operating system priorities may vary across platforms. Higher priority threads are given preference over lower priority threads for CPU time, but it's important to note that thread priorities are only hints to the scheduler and not guarantees of the execution order.

### Thread Scheduling Algorithms:
The underlying thread scheduling algorithm used by the operating system or runtime environment determines how thread priorities are honored. Common scheduling algorithms include:

* Round Robin: Threads are assigned equal time slices to execute in a cyclic manner, regardless of their priorities. 
This algorithm provides fairness but may not prioritize high-priority threads.

* Priority Scheduling: Threads with higher priorities are given preferential treatment and are executed before lower-priority threads. This algorithm ensures that high-priority threads are executed first but may lead to starvation of lower-priority threads.

* Preemptive Scheduling: The scheduler can preempt a running thread if a higher-priority thread becomes runnable. This allows higher-priority threads to take immediate control of the CPU, ensuring responsiveness and reducing the risk of priority inversion.

Thread priority and scheduling can impact the behavior and performance of a multithreaded application. Proper understanding and management of thread priorities are crucial to ensure efficient utilization of system resources and responsiveness to critical tasks.

#### Example:

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public MyThread(String name, int priority) {
        super(name);
        setPriority(priority);
    }

    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread " + getName() + " started.");

        // Perform some work

        System.out.println("Thread " + getName() + " finished.");
    }
}

public class ThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create multiple threads with different priorities
        Thread thread1 = new MyThread("Thread 1", Thread.MIN_PRIORITY);
        Thread thread2 = new MyThread("Thread 2", Thread.NORM_PRIORITY);
        Thread thread3 = new MyThread("Thread 3", Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);

        // Start the threads
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
        thread3.start();
    }
}
```

> In above example, we create three threads with different priorities using the Thread class. The first thread is assigned the minimum priority (Thread.MIN_PRIORITY), the second thread has the default priority (Thread.NORM_PRIORITY), and the third thread has the maximum priority (Thread.MAX_PRIORITY). When the threads are started, the thread scheduler will consider their priorities when making scheduling decisions. However, the exact behavior of thread scheduling and the impact of priorities may vary depending on the underlying operating system and thread scheduler implementation.
