## Introduction to Threads:

* What is a thread?
* Differences between threads and processes.
* Benefits of using threads.

## Thread Basics:

* Creating and starting threads.
* Synchronization and coordination between threads.
* Thread states: new, runnable, blocked, terminated.
* Thread priorities and scheduling.

## Thread Safety and Synchronization:

* Shared resources and race conditions.
* Critical sections and mutual exclusion.
* Synchronized blocks and methods.
* Volatile variables.

## Inter-Thread Communication:

* Communication between threads using wait() and notify().
* Producer-consumer problem and solutions.
* Blocking queues and condition variables.

## Thread Coordination:

* Joining threads.
* Thread interrupts and interruption handling.
* Thread timeouts and timed waiting.

## Thread Pools:

* Introduction to thread pools.
* Executor framework in Java.
* Creating and managing thread pools.
* Benefits and drawbacks of thread pools.

## Parallel Processing and Parallelism:

* Parallel programming concepts.
* Data parallelism vs. task parallelism.
* Parallel algorithms and data structures.
* Fork-Join framework in Java.

## Thread Safety Mechanisms:

* Locks and mutexes.
* Semaphores and barriers.
* Atomic variables.
* Read-write locks.

## Thread-Local Storage:

* Thread-local variables.
* Inheritable thread-local variables.
* Use cases and benefits of thread-local storage.

## Advanced Concepts and Techniques:

* Thread starvation and deadlock.
* Thread contention and scalability.
* Thread profiling and debugging.
* Advanced synchronization primitives (e.g., CountDownLatch, CyclicBarrier).

## Concurrent Collections:

* Thread-safe collections (e.g., ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList).
* Concurrent data structures (e.g., BlockingQueue, ConcurrentLinkedQueue).

## Advanced Multithreading Concepts:

* Asynchronous programming and futures.
* Reactive programming and event-driven architectures.
* Actor-based concurrency models (e.g., Akka framework).
